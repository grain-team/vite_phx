# Vite
[Vite.js]: https://vitejs.dev/

[![Build Status](https://github.com/mindreframer/vite_phx/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mindreframer/vite_phx/actions?query=workflow%3A%22CI%22)

Vite helps you to integrate [Vite.js] with Phoenix.

## Instructions

Add following lines to your layout template:

```elixir
<%# load the vite.js client script in dev/test environments %>
<%= Vite.vite_client() %>


<%# When using React.js, also include this preamble hot refresh code %>
<%= Vite.react_refresh_snippet() %>


<%#
entry point for your application
- delegates to [Vite.js] in dev / loads all modules / styles in production from the manifest.json
%>
<%= Vite.vite_snippet("src/main.tsx") %>
```

## Configuration

```elixir
# in config/config.exs

# Configure Vite
config :vite_phx,
  release_app: :demo,
  # to tell prod and dev env appart
  environment: Mix.env(),
  # URL/path from which to load assets (in production)
  asset_prefix: "https://static.example.com/", # defaults to "/"
  # this manifest is different from the Phoenix "cache_manifest.json"!
  vite_manifest: "priv/static/manifest.json", # optional
  phx_manifest: "priv/static/cache_manifest.json", # optional
  dev_server_address: "http://localhost:3000" # optional
```
